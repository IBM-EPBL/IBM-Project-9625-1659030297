        <h1>AWARENESS</h1>
        <h3>This page gives you more awareness about the kidney disease</h3>
        <p><br>Public awareness and media coverage of kidney disease is relatively low <br>compared to other conditions, such as heart disease or cancer.<br><br> Many people we spoke to knew that the kidneys are a vital organ,<br> that they act as a filter to remove waste products from the blood<br> stream and that they are somehow connected to ‘the waterworks’.<br><br> However, the term ‘kidney disease’ may make people think of kidney<br> failure, transplants and dialysis.<br><br> As Jim put it, “I knew you could get kidney failure and things like that,<br> but I didn’t realise you could just get something small wrong with <br>them”.<br><br> Some people thought there should be more advertising of<br> kidney disease, especially what causes it, why kidneys are important<br> for the body to stay healthy and what people can do to keep their kidneys healthy.<br><br>
            The urgency of making patients aware of CKD could be questioned on the grounds<br> that many patients die before they progress to a more severe stage<br> of CKD and many are already being treated for diabetes and/or hypertension.28,29<br><br> However, there are still compelling reasons why patients would benefit from awareness of<br> their CKD.<br><br> First, they could be made aware of medication exposures that could influence progression, including over-the-counter<br> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and contrast agents used in imaging tests.<br><br> In addition, there is evidence that appropriate early treatment (with medications and <br>hypertension control) could slow progression of CKD.29 <br><br>Also, patients should be aware that current and future medications could require dose adjustment<br> in the setting of CKD.<br><br> Many conditions, such as heart disease and cognitive decline, may increase<br> with severity of CKD, and awareness of disease may motivate patients to adopt preventive<br> strategies for these conditions.<br><br> Awareness might also make patients more vigilant with adherence to dietary recommendations for comorbid <br>hypertension and diabetes, including lower salt, sugar, and fat intake, as well as <br>other lifestyle changes.</p>

        <h2> Tips for making healthy food choices:</h2>
        <p>Cook with a mix of spices instead of salt.<br>
            Choose veggie toppings such as spinach, broccoli, and peppers for your pizza.<br>
            Try baking or broiling meat, chicken, and fish instead of frying.<br>
            Serve foods without gravy or added fats.<br>
            Try to choose foods with little or no added sugar.<br>
            Gradually work your way down from whole milk to 2 percent milk until you’re drinking and cooking with fat-free (skim) or low-fat milk and milk products.<br>
            Eat foods made from whole grains—such as whole wheat, brown rice, oats, and whole-grain corn—every day. <br>Use whole-grain bread for toast and sandwiches; substitute brown rice for white rice for home-cooked meals and when dining out.<br>
            Read food labels. Choose foods low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars.<br>
            Slow down at snack time. Eating a bag of low-fat popcorn takes longer than eating a slice of cake.<br> Peel and eat an orange instead of drinking orange juice.<br>
            Try keeping a written record of what you eat for a week.<br> It can help you see when you tend to overeat or eat foods high in fat or calories.</p>
