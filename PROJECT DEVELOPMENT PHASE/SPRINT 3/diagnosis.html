        <h1>What tests do doctors use to diagnose and monitor kidney disease?</h1>
        <h2>To check for kidney disease, health care providers use:</h2>
        <p>A blood test that checks how well your kidneys are filtering your blood,<br> called GFR. GFR stands for glomerular filtration rate.<br>
            A urine test to check for albumin.<br> Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged.<br>
            If you have kidney disease, your health care provider will use the same <br>two tests to help monitor your kidney disease and make sure your treatment plan is working.<br></p>

        <h1>Blood test for GFR</h1>
        <h2>Your health care provider will use a blood test to check your kidney<br> function.<br> The results of the test mean the following:<br></h2>

<p>A GFR of 60 or more is in the normal range.<br> Ask your health care provider when your GFR should be checked again.<br>
A GFR of less than 60 may mean you have kidney disease.<br> Talk with your health care provider about how to keep your kidney health at<br> this level.<br>
A GFR of 15 or less is called kidney failure.<br> Most people below this level need dialysis or a kidney transplant.<br> Talk with your health care provider about your treatment options.</p>
